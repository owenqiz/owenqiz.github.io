      <description>This post is an analysis of the COVID-19 situation in Montreal demonstrated in Shiny Apps.
Historical data are downloaded from Frederic Harnois’s Github repository.
The new data can either downloaded from his Github repo or scraping from Santé Montréal. An example code is as follows,

      <title>Linear Mixed Models via rstan</title>

      <description>This post is a demonstration of fitting a Linear Mixed model (LMM) under Bayesian paradiagm. Linear mixed models are an extension of simple linear models to allow both fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non independence in the data, such as longitudinal data.
1. PreliminerayFormulationIn simple linear model of \(n\) observations, we have
\[\begin{align}\boldsymbol{y}&amp;amp;= \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}+ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\\\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&amp;amp; \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{I})\end{align}\]</description>

      <description>Part 1, Written in MarchDue to my inexperience in maintaining Blogs via Github pages, each time I post a new post, the whole site will be rendered completely, some of my functions are not longer working due to the update format of the website, but I still leave this post as a note for my studies.
As the current COVID-19 situation in Canada, I am also forced to work from home.</description>

      <title>Estimating scale and correlation parameters for GEE</title>

      <description>This is a recall for some of what I have learned in 2018, Fall. Back then, the main focus was on Bayesian models. A friend asked me a question few days ago on estimating the parameters related to Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). In general, this can be comfortably handeled by the R package such as geepack, but she wanted to know the exact estimation procedures. Hence, I review some of my materials, and a book recommended by my colleague which will be referenced in the end.</description>
