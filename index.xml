      <title>Plot Area Under the Curve with ggplot2</title>

      <description>This is a very short post for a summary of the blog post, I will make a quick function for myself to graph some area under the curve for convenience.
Create your own functionIf like well-known curve, it is already defined in R such as dnorm, otherwise you can define your own function.For simplicity, I will only use standard normal (dnorm) (may update in the future).</description>

      <description>Similar to the previous post, the book is Winston, W. L., &amp;amp; Goldberg, J. B. (2004). Operations research: applications and algorithms (Vol. 3). Belmont^ eCalif Calif: Thomson/Brooks/Cole.
1. Single-Period Decision ModelsA decision maker begins by choosing a value \(q\) of a decision variable. Then a random variable \(D\) assumes a value \(d\). Finally, a cost \(c(d, q)\) is incurred. The decision maker’s goal is to choose \(q\) to minimize expected cost.</description>

      <title>A LaTeX Template for Homework</title>

      <description>Yes, there are already tons of LaTeX templates, why make another one? Well, personally, those templates are good, but not my style. I prefer putting all my solutions inside a box, but a simple box doesn’t look nice enough for me.
Consider that I will use it for a fairly long time, I just made one myself, mainly using the package tcolorbox. In the end, I end up with all my assignment using this template, except for writing a report.</description>

      <description>I have the chance to take a look on EOQ (Econmic Ordering Quantity) models recently, I simply made a short summary for quick recall.
The book I use is Winston, W. L., &amp;amp; Goldberg, J. B. (2004). Operations research: applications and algorithms (Vol. 3). Belmont^ eCalif Calif: Thomson/Brooks/Cole.
1. Assumption and NotationRepetitive ordering, Constant Demand, Constant Lead Time, Continuous Ordering.
\(K\) = setup or ordering cost\(h\) = cost of holding one unit for one unit of time\(D\) = demand rate per unit time\(r\) = rate at which firm can make product per unit time \((r&amp;gt;D)\)\(s\) = cost of being one unit short for one unit of time2.</description>

      <description>This post is mainly use for examine the rendering of the theme of the blog. The main aspect that I am care about is the support and hightlight of common use programming languages in this blog such as R and Python, some of the R code I put in this post are simple and non-informative.
R StudioTo work with R and R Markdown, for starters,
Install RInstall the lastest version of RStudioInstall knitr package using install.</description>
