      <title>Linear Mixed Models via rstan</title>

      <description>This post is a demonstration of fitting a Linear Mixed model (LMM) under Bayesian paradiagm. Linear mixed models are an extension of simple linear models to allow both fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non independence in the data, such as longitudinal data.
1. PreliminerayFormulationIn simple linear model of \(n\) observations, we have
\[\begin{align}\boldsymbol{y}&amp;amp;= \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}+ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\\\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&amp;amp; \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{I})\end{align}\]</description>

      <title>Saving Simple Features (sf) as RDS</title>
      <link>/2020/04/10/saving-simple-features-sf-as-rds/</link>

      <description>This is a very short note about how to save Simple Features or sp file into a Rds file. When downloading a map data, it contains multiple file in a folder such as shp, dbf, prj, shx etc. This is quite messy after you have some manipulations.
By saving into a single rds, it is easy to read and store. I use Montreal map as example. All we need is only the sf and dplyr for manipulations and more importantly, readr from tidyverse to write and read.</description>

      <description>Part 1, Written in MarchDue to my inexperience in maintaining Blogs via Github pages, each time I post a new post, the whole site will be rendered completely, some of my functions are not longer working due to the update format of the website, but I still leave this post as a note for my studies.
As the current COVID-19 situation in Canada, I am also forced to work from home.</description>

      <title>Estimating scale and correlation parameters for GEE</title>

      <description>This is a recall for some of what I have learned in 2018, Fall. Back then, the main focus was on Bayesian models. A friend asked me a question few days ago on estimating the parameters related to Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). In general, this can be comfortably handeled by the R package such as geepack, but she wanted to know the exact estimation procedures. Hence, I review some of my materials, and a book recommended by my colleague which will be referenced in the end.</description>

      <description>This is a very short post for a summary of the blog post, I will make a quick function for myself to graph some area under the curve for convenience.
Create your own functionIf like well-known curve, it is already defined in R such as dnorm, otherwise you can define your own function.For simplicity, I will only use standard normal (dnorm) (may update in the future).</description>

      <description>Similar to the previous post, the book is Winston, W. L., &amp;amp; Goldberg, J. B. (2004). Operations research: applications and algorithms (Vol. 3). Belmont^ eCalif Calif: Thomson/Brooks/Cole.
1. Single-Period Decision ModelsA decision maker begins by choosing a value \(q\) of a decision variable. Then a random variable \(D\) assumes a value \(d\). Finally, a cost \(c(d, q)\) is incurred. The decision maker’s goal is to choose \(q\) to minimize expected cost.</description>

      <title>A LaTeX Template for Homework</title>

      <guid>/2019/02/19/a-latex-template-for-homework/</guid>
      <description>Yes, there are already tons of LaTeX templates, why make another one? Well, personally, those templates are good, but not my style. I prefer putting all my solutions inside a box, but a simple box doesn’t look nice enough for me.
Consider that I will use it for a fairly long time, I just made one myself, mainly using the package tcolorbox. In the end, I end up with all my assignment using this template, except for writing a report.</description>

      <description>I have the chance to take a look on EOQ (Econmic Ordering Quantity) models recently, I simply made a short summary for quick recall.
The book I use is Winston, W. L., &amp;amp; Goldberg, J. B. (2004). Operations research: applications and algorithms (Vol. 3). Belmont^ eCalif Calif: Thomson/Brooks/Cole.
1. Assumption and NotationRepetitive ordering, Constant Demand, Constant Lead Time, Continuous Ordering.
\(K\) = setup or ordering cost\(h\) = cost of holding one unit for one unit of time\(D\) = demand rate per unit time\(r\) = rate at which firm can make product per unit time \((r&amp;gt;D)\)\(s\) = cost of being one unit short for one unit of time2.</description>

      <description>This post is mainly use for examine the rendering of the theme of the blog. The main aspect that I am care about is the support and hightlight of common use programming languages in this blog such as R and Python, some of the R code I put in this post are simple and non-informative.
R StudioTo work with R and R Markdown, for starters,
Install RInstall the lastest version of RStudioInstall knitr package using install.</description>
