      <description>As I am going to get my first dose next week, I would like have some ideas about the safety of the vaccine. In Canada, AstraZeneca (AZ) and Pfizer are delivered. But recently, AZ are no longer suggested in province like Quebec and Ontario. I am going to use the available data on US.
Vaccination in USAnd vaccinations data are available on Our World in Data.</description>

      <description>Part 1, Written in MarchDue to my inexperience in maintaining Blogs via Github pages, each time I post a new post, the whole site will be rendered completely, some of my functions are not longer working due to the update format of the website, but I still leave this post as a note for my studies.
As the current COVID-19 situation in Canada, I am also forced to work from home.</description>

      <description>This is a very short post for a summary of the blog post, I will make a quick function for myself to graph some area under the curve for convenience.
Create your own functionIf like well-known curve, it is already defined in R such as dnorm, otherwise you can define your own function.For simplicity, I will only use standard normal (dnorm) (may update in the future).</description>
