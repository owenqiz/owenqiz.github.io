      <description>As COVID-19 situation in Canada, I am also forced to work from home. During the weekend, I try to learn some stuff for fun. This post will illustrate the map reflecting the COVID-19 count in Quebec.
To obtain the data, we first scrape the information from the goverment’s website Quebec.ca, who provides daily updates upto the Administrative Region level. This time I will use rvest to grab the information.</description>

      <description>This is a very short post for a summary of the blog post, I will make a quick function for myself to graph some area under the curve for convenience.
Create your own functionIf like well-known curve, it is already defined in R such as dnorm, otherwise you can define your own function.For simplicity, I will only use standard normal (dnorm) (may update in the future).</description>
