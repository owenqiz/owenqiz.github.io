      <description>This is a recall for some of what I have learned last year, back then the main focus was on Bayesian models, but this time, a friend ask me a question on estimating the parameters related to Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). In general, this can be comfortably handeled by the R package such as geepack, but she want to know the exact estimation procedures. Hence, I review some of my materials, and a book recommended by my colleague which will be referenced in the end.</description>

      <title>Plot Area Under the Curve with ggplot2</title>

      <description>This is a very short post for a summary of the blog post, I will make a quick function for myself to graph some area under the curve for convenience.
Create your own functionIf like well-known curve, it is already defined in R such as dnorm, otherwise you can define your own function.For simplicity, I will only use standard normal (dnorm) (may update in the future).</description>
